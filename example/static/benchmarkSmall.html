    <h1>Some static content</h1>
    <p>This is just some content to attempt to understand the parsing overhead.</p>
    <p>As soon as compoxure starts making calls to other services any benchmark is actually a test of
       either Redis or the network depending on how the test is configured.</p>
   </p>This test has no external calls, so is just testing the overhead that actually parsing html has.</p>
